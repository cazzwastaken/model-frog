# 👾 About
A very simple CS:GO model changer with an included `sv_pure` bypass.

## Usage
1. Models can be found [here](https://gamebanana.com/)
2. Extract to `game_dir/csgo/`
3. In `FindModel()`, replace your models
4. Inject into CS:GO process before map load (see todo)

## Todo
- [ ] Add a UI instead of hard-coding the models
- [ ] Use precached models instead of FindModel to allow for instant model updates [src](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/counterstrike-global-offensive/214919-precache-models.html)
